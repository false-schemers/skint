# SKINT Precursors
                         
This directory contains #F/Scheme code for autogenerated parts of SKINT C source code. 
To re-generate these C files, one has to have working version of SKINT interpreter and [SFC compiler](https://github.com/false-schemers/sharpF). 
Generation is performed with the help of Skint scripts located here (they have the `.ssc` suffix). Assuming that both `skint` and `sfc` binaries are just above
the skint directory tree, the following commands will do the trick:

```
$ ./skint skint/pre/nsf2h.ssc skint/pre/n.sf skint/n.h
$ ./skint skint/pre/nsf2c.ssc skint/pre/n.sf skint/n.c
$ ./skint skint/pre/scm2c.ssc skint/pre/s.scm skint/s.c
$ ./skint skint/pre/scm2c.ssc skint/pre/t.scm skint/t.c
$ ./skint skint/pre/ksf2c.ssc ./sfc skint/pre/k.sf skint/k.c
```

Please note that this step is optional, but may be needed to make enhancements and fix bugs in the
autogenerated C code.
